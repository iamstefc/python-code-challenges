# Python Code Challenges

Python Code Challenges will be a space where I continue to develop my Python programming skills. Exercises will be directly based on algorithmic challenges from **LeetCode** and **HackerRank**.

Throughout the code solutions, I will try to log my journey by creating comments and documentation on my approach.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized into respective directories for clarity:

* `leetcode/`: Contains solutions to LeetCode problems, typically named by problem number and title (e.g., `1_two_sum.py`)

## Setup and Development Environment

I primarily develop my solutions using **Jupyter Notebook** within the **Anaconda** distribution on Windows. Anaconda is open-source, so that's a plus! I recently started to use their web-based platform which allieviate my machine's performance and storage.

To set up your environment:

1. Download Python

- Download the latest version for Windows https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Follow the prompts during execution. I make sure to add Python to PATH and maintain default settings

2. Download Anaconda

- Download the latest version for Windows https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution 
- By signing up, you will gain access to the AI web-based platform and various resources to help you get started
- Follow the recommended settings during installation
- Whether you decide to go local or cloud, you should be able to see the Jupyter Notebook option
