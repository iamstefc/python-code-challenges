# Python Code Challenges

Python Code Challenges will be a space where I continue to develop my Python programming skills. Exercises will be directly based on algorithmic challenges from **LeetCode** and **HackerRank**.

Throughout the code solutions, I will try to log my journey by creating comments and documentation on my approach.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized into respective directories for clarity:

* `leetcode/`: Contains solutions to LeetCode problems, typically named by problem number and title (e.g., `1_two_sum.py`)

## Setup and Development Environment

I primarily develop my solutions using **Jupyter Notebook** within the **Anaconda** distribution on Windows. Anaconda is open-source, so that's a plus! I recently started to use their web-based platform which allieviate my machine's performance and storage.

To set up your environment:

1. Download Python

- Download the latest version for Windows https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Follow the prompts during execution. I make sure to add Python to PATH and maintain default settings

2. Download Anaconda

- Download the latest version for Windows https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution 
- By signing up, you will gain access to the AI web-based platform and various resources to help you get started
- Follow the recommended settings during installation
- Whether you decide to go local or cloud, you should be able to see the Jupyter Notebook option

## Challenge Log

This table provides an overview of the challenges I've worked on:

| # | Title | Source | Solution Link | End Goal | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
 | 1 | two sum | [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/) | TBA | Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order |
 | 2 | add two numbers | [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) | TBA | You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. |
